All the functions related to picking up items.

*maxammo* is the array that defines how much of each type of ammo you can carry.

*clipammo* is the array that defines how much you are given when you pick up a small size of ammo. The bigger size of ammo is derived from the small size by multiplying by 5 (10 x 5 = 50 bullets; 4 x 5 = 20 shells, etc.).

*P_GiveAmmo* is the function that is called when the player picks up ammo. Returns false if the quantity is maxed out already or if the weapon does not need ammo. This function also automatically switches to the weapon that corresponds to the ammo picked up if the player's weapon that is currently up has no ammo or is the fist.

*P_GiveWeapon* is the function that determines whether the player already owns a weapon they picked up. Returns true/false depending on whether the function modified the amount of ammo of the player or if it gave a new weapon to the player. Apparently, the returned value of this function is used to remove the weapon object from the game when true.

*P_GiveBody* is a simple function that gives a certain amount of health to the player. Returns false if the player is already at the maximum amount of health allowed.

*P_GiveArmor* is basically the same as *P_GiveBody* but for the armor.

Obviously, *P_GiveCard* adds a card to the player's inventory.

*P_GivePower* simply handles temporary powerups as well as berserk.

*P_TouchSpecialThing* displays status messages when picking up items. It also plays the appropriate pickup sound. The bug that never shows the "you got a medikit you really needed" message lives in this function.

*P_KillMobj* handles what to do when killing objects. This function keeps track of the kill count and modifies the flags (MF_NOGRAVITY, MF_CORPSE, MF_SOLID, etc.) of the target. It also handles the objects that are dropped when the object dies.

*P_DamageMobj* handles damages inflicted to the player, including modifiers such as skill level and armor. Also handles damages inflicted to monsters.

## p_lights.c

*T_FireFlicker* seems to add a randomized amount to the brightness of the level provided that the light level does not go beyond a min and a max threshold. The function returns nothing.

*P_SpawnFireFlicker* handles sectors that have the light flickering attribute. It looks like the brightness of the flickers can not exceed the sector's original brightness. The minimum value is equal to the brightness of the least bright adjacent sector... plus 16! Who knows why.

*T_LightFlash* has a similar logic, with a random value in the mix.

*P_SpawnLightFlash* is even more similar to *P_SpawnFireFlicker* and, like *T_LightFlash*, it also includes randomness.

The code of *T_StrobeFlash* is almost identical to *T_LightFlash*. No randomess, though.

*P_SpawnStrobeFlash* takes fastOrSlow and inSync as arguments, along with a sector object. Once again, the code looks very similar to the previous functions. It executes *T_StrobeFlash*.

*EV_StartLightStrobing* is the function that starts *P_SpawnStrobeFlash*. It is triggered by a line on the map.

*EV_TurnTagLightsOff* looks slightly confusing. It looks for a match between the tag of a sector and the tag of a line, which means that it is triggered by a line. However, I am not sure what its effect is. Turn the light level of all sectors to the brightness of the least bright sector?

*EV_LightTurnOn* does the opposite (I think) of *EV_TurnTagLightsOff*.

*T_Glow* gradually increments/decrements the light level of the targeted sector.

*P_SpawnGlowingLight* starts the glowing effect.

## p_map.c

*PIT_StompThing* is the function that controls telefragging. It inflics 10,000 points of damage to the target.

*P_TeleportMove* moves the thing to the new subsector.

*PIT_CheckLine* takes a linedef as an argument and returns false if the line can not be crossed by the object. This include cases where the line is one-sided or the line has a block monster flag. It also somewhat keeps tracks of the special tags.

*PIT_CheckThing* does a collision check for things. This function does include the code that damages the target of the melee attack of lost souls as well as the code that damages targets from missiles. Returns false when the projectile stops and true if it can keep going.

Apparently, *P_CheckPosition* is purely informative. It will return false if the thing is a solid wall or a thing.

*P_TryMove* returns true and moves the thing to the set coordinates if possible. This is where special line triggers that the player or monsters walk on are activated. I believe also that this is the part of the code that prevents thing from stepping up more than 24 units at a time and where the noclip mode works its magic.

*P_ThingHeightClip* is called when a sector changes height to check if a thing fits in the sector. If not, the function returns false and will clip the thing to the sector height.

*P_HitSlideLine* takes a line as an argument. This function does not return anything but it sets the tmxmove and tmymove variables (of type fixed_t) to zero when appropriate.

*PTR_SlideTraverse* seems to be the function that decides how the player is going to slide when colliding with a wall. It returns true when the line is not blocking and false when it intercepts things.

*P_SlideMove* does not return anything. It seems to be the function that actually does the sliding.
