typedef
// typedef is a reserved keyword in the C and C++ programming languages.
// It is used to create an alias name for another data type.
struct 
// A struct in the C programming language is a complex data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables to be placed under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer
extern
// In the C programming language, an external variable is a variable defined outside any function block.
// On the other hand, a local (automatic) variable is a variable defined inside a function block.
#define CONSTANT value
// The #define directive causes the compiler to substitute "value" for each occurrence of "CONSTANT" in the source file.
